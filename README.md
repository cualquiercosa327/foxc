# foxc
A port/fork of the Fox Toolkit to C.

What would it look like if you took the Fox Toolkit and ported it to an
"object oriented" C? The answer to this question is in this repository.

This is not a serious project.

Some functions have the prefix "dtk" or "dk". This is due to the previous
name of this experiment and will be changed to "fxc" or "fx".

CMake build support is completely untested/unsupported. Patches welcome.
